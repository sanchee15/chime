## What is Normal Distribution?

In, this type of distribution we have a bell shaped curve
and are symmetrical with central tendency being the mean/average of data.

Span of the normal distribution is governed by standard deviation which 
means the lesser the standard deviation, more is the density of data in a 
particular region. Suppose, the endpoints are n distance away from the mean, 
then this means that enpoints are n standard deviations + mean away.

Additionally, the mean and median are same for normal distribution.
