##What is z-score?

Z-score is also known as standard score. It is a measure of how many 
standard deviations is an element away from the mean.

###z = (X-mu)/sigma
where X is the value of the element
mu = Mean 
sigma = Standard Deviation 

eg. A z-score of 2.5 means that the element is +2.5 standard deviations
away from the mean.

Also, it is a test statistic for Z-tests that measures the difference between 
an observed statistic and mean in units of standard deviation.

Converting an observation to Z-value is called standardization.
