##What does true postive mean?

We often feel confused whenever we come accross terms 
* True Positive
* False Positive
* True Negative 
* False Negative

True positive is also called sensitivity.

True negative is also called specificity. 

###Just keep in mind :
True reflects identifying the event **correctly**.
False indicates an **error** in evaluation process.
Positive means we **identified** outcome of event. 
Negative means we **rejected** outcome of event.

For example - There was a test for which 100 people appeared. Out of 100,
40 actually had Cancer. But only 30 were identified as having Cancer.
Even out of rest healthy 60 people, 5 were identified as having cancer. 

So for this case, 
True Positive - People who actually had cancer were identified as having cancer. 
30 
False Positive - People who were actually having cancer but were rejected to 
have cancer. 5
True Negative - People who did not have cancer and were not even identified as 
cancer patients. 55
False Negative - People who had cancer but were incorrectly rejected and were 
identified as healthy. 10
