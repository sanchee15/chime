## What is dimensionality reduction?

It is a process of reducing the number of randon variables under 
consideration. Uncorrelated random variables play a crucial role in this.
It is a way of mathematical representation by which we can describe some 
amount of variance of our data. This way we retain useful information by 
reducing the amount of information required to represent the data. It is 
a way by which we reduce signal to noise ratio. 

**It involves transformation of data into low-dimesional space where data
preserves its eucledian nature and does not suffer from 
_curse of dimensionality_.**


It can be divided into two types:
* Feature selection - In this method, we figure out a way to find more 
important features in given set of features and then use this subset of 
features.

* Feature extraction - Here, we build new set of features from existing features.
