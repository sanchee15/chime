## What is generalization?

Generalization is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on
new/unseen tasks when trained with existing data by gaining experience.

It heavily relies on probability and statistics to yield better predictions.
Best generalizations often consider the complexity of hypothesis with respect
to the function of data.
