## What is Probability Density Function and Probability Mass Function ?

**PDF** also known as Probability Density Function or density of a continuous 
function that describes the relative likelihood of a random variable to take 
a given value.
For finding PDF, we can find the area under the curve. Since, the area under 
curve is integral of f(x) between the given limits, we can easily denote it as

P(x1<X<x2) = Integral over range x1, x2 for function f(x)

**PMF** also known as Probability Mass Function is a function that gives the 
probability that a discrete random variable is equal to a value.

f(X=x) = P(X=x)

_Note:_ Summation(f(x)) over X = 1.
